# Lindy Briggs hw2

## Description

For this homework assignment, I accomplished the following:

* Created an html web page with my name, a photo of myself, and links to sections about myself, my work, and how to contact me

* When clicked, links in the header/navigation scroll the UI to the correponding section

* The section about my work has titled image of my applications, with the first image being larger than the others. Clicking the images opens a new tab to that deployed application

* When users resize their page, the site dynamically adapts to that given viewport

* Created a repo on github and added a README file, css stylesheet, html file, and other necessary files like images, etc.

* Sucessfully pushed commits to this github repo with detailed messages
